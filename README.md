I had the opportunity to work with a company that needed emails scrapped and stored in a DB, a portion of a contract job that I coded unable to give out the entire program, but I think this part was pretty cool as I had not yet worked with the selenium library. It is a straightforward script that might give someone some insight while trying to get the dang driver to work. 1. Logs in 2. Clicks on destination HTML 3. Enters Customer ID into search field 4. FInds account 5. Extract Email
